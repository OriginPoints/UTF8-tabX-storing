# UTF8-tabX-storing

In order to save utf8 characters without having to manually type them, I'm going to create a list with all of them and show them using either the shared.(e.g) or _G(e.g) supplied functions.

managing utf8 characters in required modules that are either piled in the user's self-script (where it is situated) or rep storage, which will undoubtedly be a wonderful spot.

I'm working on value distribution, which cannot be accessed through low-end servers, thus this will occasionally aid me (using HttpService on the client which is thenically impossible)
